# Speech-to-Text-System
A Python-based speech recognition system that converts audio input into readable text using AI and audio processing libraries.

🧠 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁 𝗗𝗲𝘀𝗰𝗿𝗶𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻

This project focuses on developing a Speech-to-Text System that converts spoken audio into readable text using Artificial Intelligence. The system processes user-provided audio files and accurately transcribes the spoken content.
To ensure compatibility, audio files are converted into a supported PCM WAV format before processing. The application includes error handling for unsupported formats and unclear speech, ensuring smooth execution in Google Colab.
Speech-to-text technology plays a crucial role in virtual assistants, accessibility tools, automated transcription systems, and customer service automation.
